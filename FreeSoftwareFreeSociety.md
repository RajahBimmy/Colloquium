# Free Software, Free Society (2002)

## Richard Stallman

### Relevance

Coming into this colloquium, I thought me and Stallman were going to be on the same page, but when I got to reading him, I found myself backing off more and more. It's like when people say "Socialism works in theory." Stallman does have good ideas, but they don't always translate smoothly into practical application. To be honest, his unswerving commitment makes him sound more like Leibniz; and his willingness to let jobs go to waste in the name of Freedom concerns me. That being said, the way the Open Source movement took the premise to his idea and ran with it has me really excited about working on projects.

### Context

Free Software, Free Society is the manifesto for Richard Stallman's Free Software revolution. It maintains his belief that all programs should have accessible source code upon demand, that way users can make their own modifications to, seeing as they downloaded/paid for it in the first place. It is published under the GNU Free Documentation License.

### Quotes

* "'If you share with your neighbor, you are a pirate. If you want any changes, beg us to make them.' The idea that the proprietary-software social system—the system that says you are not allowed to share or change software—is antisocial, that it is unethical, that it is simply wrong, may come as a surprise to some readers. But what else could we say about a system based on dividing the public and keeping users helpless?"
  * By not being Free, you harm man's right to communicate.
* "The term “free software” is sometimes misunderstood—it has nothing to do with price. It is about freedom. Here, therefore, is the definition of free software: a program is free software, for you, a particular user, if (Freedoms 0-3):
  * You have the freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
  * You have the freedom to modify the program to suit your needs. (To make this freedom effective in practice, you must have access to the source code, since making changes in a program without having the source code is exceedingly difficult.)
  * You have the freedom to redistribute copies, either gratis or for a fee.
  * You have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, so that the community can benefit from your improvements."
* "Watch out, though—a number of companies that associate themselves with the term “open source” actually base their business on non-free software that works with free software. These are not free software companies, they are proprietary software companies whose products tempt users away from freedom. They call these “value added,” which reflects the values they would like us to adopt: convenience above freedom. If we value freedom more, we should call them “freedom subtracted” products. ... The GNU Project continues to use the term “free software,” to express the idea that freedom, not just technology, is important."
  * Machiavelli would like this in __The Prince__, worry less about your ideals, and more about execution.
* "If I get donations of money, I may be able to hire a few people full or part time. The salary won’t be high by programmers’ standards, but I’m looking for people for whom building community spirit is as important as making money."
  * McConnell would argue that Stallman is trying to kill the field of talent. He would probably pull from Hobbes to say that competition is what drives us to make great things, not just hope for an ideal society.
* "“Free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.”"
* "The copyright system grew up with printing—a technology for mass production copying. Copyright fit in well with this technology because it restricted only the mass producers of copies. It did not take freedom away from readers of books. An ordinary reader, who did not own a printing press, could copy books only with pen and ink, and few readers were sued for that. ... Society also needs freedom. When a program has an owner, the users lose freedom to control part of their own lives."
  * Stallman is opposed to all ideas of a Sovereign or a Prince. In his mind, once you get the code, it's yours to do with entirely as you wish.
* "For the Open Source movement, the issue of whether software should be open source is a practical question, not an ethical one. As one person put it, “Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement.” For the Open Source movement, non-free software is a suboptimal solution. For the Free Software movement, non-free software is a social problem and free software is the solution."
  * It seems like Tim Berners-Lee thinks its both.
* "Why do users think that proprietary manuals are good enough? Some have not considered the issue. I hope this article will do something to change that."
  * This was Raymond's exact critique in both __The Cathedral and the Bazaar__ and __Free as in Freedom__, that Stallman got too caught up in research and documentation, and not enough in navigating the field.
* "Science Must ‘Push’ Copyright Aside"
  * Anything which blocks progress should be eliminated (think Mosaic)
* "If software were free, there would still be programmers, but perhaps fewer of them. Would this be bad for society? Not necessarily. Today the advanced nations have fewer farmers than in 1900, but we do not think this is bad for society, because the few deliver more food to the consumers than the many used to do."
  * See above for McConnell's argument.
* "This includes recipes, computer programs, manuals and textbooks, and reference works like dictionaries and encyclopedias. For all these functional works, I believe that the issues are basically the same as they are for software and the same conclusions apply. People should have the freedom even to publish a modified version because it’s very useful to modify functional works."
