# The Prince (1532)

## Niccolo Machiavelli

### Relevance

Machiavelli is very concerned with how to get a society running. He, McConnell, and Brooks could probably all sit down for a few drinks and hash this one out. At the end of the day, you want to be firm with what you do, and that sometimes means not taking the most "obvious" route if it locks you into a situation which is uncharacteristic of the machine you're attempting to build. For example, when Berners-Lee built the web, he switched from Objective-C to C because the philosophy was to allow everyone to use it. In this case, it made sense. At the same time, if your goal is to make a project which people need to access, but it would require you to write your own dependencies, just compromise on the language which gets you their the fastest. Don't reinvent the wheel.

### Context

A hundred years before Hobbes, Machiavelli already had the right can-do attitude to get shit done. The Prince stands as a work whose primary focus is not to run the best society, but rather to run the society the best way you can. At the time, Machiavelli was called a "teacher of evil" and admonished for his radical views, but at the end of the day, this isn't a Manifesto, it's an instruction manual. McConnell sees most eye-to-eye with Machiavelli, although Raymond is definitely cut from the same cloth. If you're gonna do it, do it right.

### Quotes

* "A prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled."
  * Don't worry about requests for features which are unnecessary, and focus more on the immediate user base.
* "Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of ambition or through fear, as one has seen already."
  * At the end of the day, if getting what you want (Stallman) is hard, you have to be willing to make compromises to further your project (Raymond/Torvalds)
* "And above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be under any obligation to you for them."
  * Stallman and the Sovereign subscribe to this. Order is key to success.
* "Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits."
  * This is __How to Design Programs'__ design philosophy. Find the problems, then code around the corner cases so that way debugging won't kill you.
* "A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles, accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions."
  * In line with Hobbes' idea that we chain ourselves to a __Leviathan__ to prevent mutually assured destruction.
* "It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether he has always need of the assistance of others."
  * This is Stallman's idea in a nutshell. Free Software should be wholly reliant on other Free Software. That being said, this isn't always the most implementable solution, and could in practice cripple the Prince in gaining power swiftly, so Raymond and Berners-Lee would disagree here.
* "Hence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity."
  * Prudency when running a project is ideal. Know when you cannot take anything else away.
* "Either you are a prince in fact, or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal"
  * This is the difference between operating as a leader amongst a community or offering your service to one. Microsoft would be in shambles if they bent to every request, at the same time that open source projects would have no interest if authors weren't willing to collaborate. Pick a method and find your boundaries.
* "Nevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated"
  * When Torvalds admits to liking Powerpoint, that's caving in to the beast. We're allowed to not love aspects of our neighbor, but our job is to work with what we've got.
* "A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a downright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not."
  * Be firm and consistent when running a project. That's Brooks' entire philosophy in __The Mythical Man-Month__
