# The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1999)

## Eric S. Raymond

### Relevance

Raymond's idea of compromise is what the modern developer needs. If we subscribe to the Stallman-esque belief that things should be perfect and accessible to all, we'll never get anywhere because we'll be too busy waiting on everyone else. When fused with Weaving the Web, The Cathedral and the Bazaar acts as a map for social development through exciting projects. It's the whole idea that communities can grow and make each other better through having a shared project. The Cathedral model stresses that source code should be fully available and mutable at each level of release, whereas the Bazaar model is more about getting collaboration in places you'd never expect, and always keeping the most up-to-date code available online. Sometimes we rely on non-Free or non-open source software to develop our open source applications. So what? If that's a problem down the line, replace it when you have to. Otherwise, build fast and build working things. Machiavelli would appreciate this idea of subscribing to parts of an idea without compromising the state (of software) through reliance on it.

### Context

Eric S. Raymond was fed up with Stallman's relentless pursuit of the Free Software movement. As a response, he wrote The Cathedral and the Bazaar to illustrate his own experiences within development communities, and try to find a middle ground where compromise can exist. The Cathedral and the Bazaar functions much in the same way Candide did back in the day. While less satirical, the aim is to take a belief to which groups unswervingly subscribe, and try to poke holes in only taking this one look at the world. The book launched Raymond into the spotlight of the Open Source movement, and in turn pushed the movement away from Free Software even more.

### Quotes

__Linus's Law:__ "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"

1. Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
3. Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' The Mythical Man-Month)
4. If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
5. When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
6. Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
7. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
8. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
9. Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
10. If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
11. The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
12. Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
13. Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)
14. Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
15. When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
16. When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
17. A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
18. To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
19. Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.
