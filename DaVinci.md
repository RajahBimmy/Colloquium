# Da Vinci's Notebooks (~1519)

## Leonardo Da Vinci

### Relevance

Da Vinci's work can be contextualized by taking his idea of an artist, and fusing it with our idea of the programmer. It is his duty to take vision and turn it into a product, and he works best when in the company of others. We take this comparison to a whole new level when the art made is a collaboration, not just a neighboring invention. He believes that we inherently have an itch to scratch, and prophesizes the eventual birth of the world wide web as a means for communication.

### Context

Da Vinci's notebooks are a collection of works the artist wrote during his lifetime. Comprised primarily of instructions on how to be a good artist, there is also a fair amount of parable and prophesy in the later chapters.

### Quotes

* "I say and insist that drawing in company is much better than alone, for many reasons. The first is that you would be ashamed to be seen behindhand among the students, and such shame will lead you to careful study. Secondly, a wholesome emulation will stimulate you to be among those who are more praised than yourself, and this praise of others will spur you on. Another is that you can learn from the drawings of others who do better than yourself; and if you are better than they, you can profit by your contempt for their defects, while the praise of others will incite you to farther merits."
  * Working in a community is better for spirit, as our desire to compete and thrive will make us work our best.
* "Old men ought to be represented with slow and heavy movements, their legs bent at the knees, when they stand still, and their feet placed parallel and apart; bending low with the head leaning forward, and their arms but little extended."
  * Objects should be unique. Just as different features differentiate between types of a larger human class, the instances should have unique pieces of data to tell them apart.
* "Though you may be able to tell or write the exact description of forms, the painter can so depict them that they will appear alive, with the shadow and light which show the expression of a face; which you cannot accomplish with the pen though it can be achieved by the brush."
  * The programmer is the modern painter, and the strongest are able to take the ideas conveyed to them by clients, and convert them into functioning programs. The manager may work as a liason to carry out the project, but the programmer is the real artist.
* "The painter strives and competes with nature."
  * Based on Hobbes' idea that we do have an inherently competitive nature in us. This isn't a bad thing by any means, and in fact draws us to do bigger things than we could ever imagine.
* "Allegorical Representations"
  * As Locke explained in __An Essay on Human Understanding__, we understand concepts best when presented with abstractions of them.
* "If you wish to make a figure in marble, first make one of clay, and when you have finished it, let it dry and place it in a case which should be large enough, after the figure is taken out of it, to receive also the marble, from which you intend to reveal the figure in imitation of the one in clay."
  * Supports Brooks' idea for Test-Driven Development. Don't worry a ton about throwing a copy away, or kill your darlings.
* "Necessity is the mistress and guide of nature. Necessity is the theme and the inventress, the eternal curb and law of nature."
  * Brooks maintains that the whole reason we program stems from an inherent desire to build things. We love scratching the itch of making something we might even find necessary on a whim.
* "Of writing Letters from one Country to another: Men will speak with each other from the most remote countries, and reply."
  * This prophesy comes true through Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web.
