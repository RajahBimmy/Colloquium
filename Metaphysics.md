# Metaphysics (~322 B.C.)

## Aristotle

### Relevance

Metaphysics works in conjunction with the Categories to give more solid meaning to Plato's __Republic.__ It introduces structure which objects should adhere to, and these strict guidelines allow for a semantic and philosophical foundation to build programs upon. McConnell relies heavily on this structure.

### Context

Aristotle's Metaphysics is taking Plato's idea of the forms from __The Republic__, and bringing them down to earth and into tangible instances of the ideal. It struggles with the idea that things are permanently what they are, yet the way they are is always changing.

### Quotes

* "A question connected with these is whether numbers and bodies and planes and points are substances of a kind, or not. If they are not, it baffles us to say what being is and what the substances of things are. For modifications and movements and relations and dispositions and ratios do not seem to indicate the substance of anything; for all are predicated of a subject, and none is a 'this'."
  * The features that compose an object must act in conjunction to form an active one. Aristotle is also introducing us to the idea of "This"
* "Let this, then, suffice to show (1) that the most indisputable of all beliefs is that contradictory statements are not at the same time true, and (2) what consequences follow from the assertion that they are, and (3) why people do assert this."
  * It is impossible for something to both be and not be at the same time, which is why we can only call non-static instances once we know we have an instance of a thing.
* "'Element' means (1) the primary component immanent in a thing, and indivisible in kind into other kinds"
  * Elements are the Types which act as components to other things. Elements can be composed of other elements in turn.
* "But is being-a-cloak an essence at all? Probably not. For the essence is precisely what something is; but when an attribute is asserted of a subject other than itself, the complex is not precisely what some 'this' is, e.g. white man is not precisely what some 'this' is, since thisness belongs only to substances. Therefore there is an essence only of those things whose formula is a definition."
  * Things can only be compared and contrasted when their definitions are know. i.e. why we can't compare a dog instance to a potato instance.
* "Further, some do not think there is anything substantial besides sensible things, but others think there are eternal substances which are more in number and more real; e.g. Plato posited two kinds of substance-the Forms and objects of mathematics-as well as a third kind, viz. the substance of sensible bodies."
  * There is a clear difference between the form of a thing and the instance of a thing.
* "Since a definition is a formula, and every formula has parts, and as the formula is to the thing, so is the part of the formula to the part of the thing, the question is already being asked whether the formula of the parts must be present in the formula of the whole or not."
  * There's an algorithm to defining all functions you intend to use. __How to Design Programs__ enforces this heavily, as does __Code Complete.__ Likewise, formulas can exist within definitions (i.e. how we can call functions in constructors)
* "Since even the mathematician uses the common axioms only in a special application, it must be the business of first philosophy to examine the principles of mathematics also."
  * We need to use axioms and the mathematical process to move beyond numbers and into the tangible world. This is the crossroads of computer science as flowing from math but also being extremely tangible.
* "There are three kinds of substance-the matter, which is a 'this' in appearance (for all things that are characterized by contact and not, by organic unity are matter and substratum, e.g. fire, flesh, head; for these are all matter, and the last matter is the matter of that which is in the full sense substance); the nature, which is a 'this' or positive state towards which movement takes place; and again, thirdly, the particular substance which is composed of these two"
  * Much like the statement two above this one, we encounter a further expansion on the idea that there exists an ideal form of a thing, and the specific instance of the thing.
* "We must consider also in which of two ways the nature of the universe contains the good, and the highest good, whether as something separate and by itself, or as the order of the parts. Probably in both ways, as an army does; for its good is found both in its order and in its leader, and more in the latter ... The rule of many is not good; one ruler let there be."
  * Ordering is important to data maintenance. If we do not offer hierarchies with our data, then it will become a mess and unintelligent.
* ""It has, then, been sufficiently pointed out that the objects of mathematics are not substances in a higher degree than bodies are, and that they are not prior to sensibles in being, but only in definition, and that they cannot exist somewhere apart. But since it was not possible for them to exist in sensibles either, it is plain that they either do not exist at all or exist in a special sense and therefore do not 'exist' without qualification. For 'exist' has many senses."
  * This is the paradox of mathematical objects being unable to exist. With computer science, that outlook is put to bed quickly, as science has moved far enough to make this a tangible reality (whether just in memory or through graphical visualizations)
