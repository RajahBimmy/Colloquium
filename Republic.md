# The Republic (~380 B.C.)

## Plato

### Relevance

Forms are the most essential building block to Object-Oriented programming. While according to his definition, instances of classes would fall into the AB level (representations of tangible objects), I challenge that they actually fall into the CD level, as they are physically untouchable by us and exist in a near-perfect state. They are stripped down to their essentials in definition, rather than focusing on the details. While details can be stored, the blueprint doesn't explicitly assign those roles. What I mean is a class should be on the CD level, while an instance might fall on the AB level, skipping CD entirely. Aristotle expands on Plato's ideas of what makes a Form a Form in Metaphysics.

### Context

Plato's Republic sought to find an accurate definition for justice, as well as explain the best way to run a society. Along the way, he established his own theory of the Forms, through the allegories of the Cave and Line.

### Quotes

* Allegory of the Cave, and returning
  * This is the same as seeing a new perspective, but being so committed to the one you have already prescribed to, you actively reject it. Think Candide and Free Software.
* Analogy of the Line
  * DE
    * The purest form, that which does not exist, but is the template for all things.
  * CD
    * Our knowledge of the pure thing. The second we think of it, we are removed from a pure instance of it.
  * BC
    * A tangible version of the thing
  * AB
    * A representation of the thing (i.e. shadow, or art)
  * "Now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide each of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main divisions to answer, one to the visible and the other to the intelligible, and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness, and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists of images. And by images I mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the like: Do you understand?"
  * "There are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can only be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making no use of images as in the former case, but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves (510b)."
  * "And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as first principles, but only as hypotheses â€” that is to say, as steps and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole (511b)"
