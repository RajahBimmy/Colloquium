# The Categories (~322 B.C.)

## Aristotle

### Relevance

Aristotle's categories can be applied to both individual objects and large data sets. His philosophy of objects having certain traits, abilities, and instances stand as a staple of modern Object-Oriented programming. He expands on the idea that not all attributes are necessary to make an object an object, and that it is incapable for one object to have more object-ness than another, however since this leads to a paradox when comparing two, it is possible that an object can have more of one trait than another, thus leading to comparison methods.

### Context

Aristotle's Categories state that all things have a Substance, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Physical Location, Temporal Location, Position, Possession, Abilities, and Passions. This has been the building block for many discussions of the ways to classify things.

### Quotes

* "Of things incomplex enunciated, each signifies either Substance, or Quantity, or Quality, or Relation, or Where, or When, or Position, or Possession, or Action, or Passion."
  * The different states and descriptors for sets of instances adhering to the same object model.
* "for one 'man' is not more 'man' than another, as one 'white thing' is more and less 'white' than another"
  * On the greatness of substances. We cannot compare them based on being more of itself than another, but rather we must find traits to allow for these comparisons to take place.
* "A mountain, for instance, is called 'little', but a millet seed 'large,' from the fact of the one being greater, but the other less, in respect of things of the same nature, whence the relation is to something else, since if each were called 'small' or 'great' of itself, the mountain would never have been called 'small,' nor the seed 'large.'"
  * Types change our definition. If I have two data sets, I want comparators to be unique to type.
* "It is the especial peculiarity of quantity to be called 'equal' and 'unequal'"
  * Two states of being, if unequal, perform action based on what kind of inequality we're working with.
* "Such things are termed 'relatives,' which are said to be what they are, from belonging to other things, or in whatever other way they may be referred to something else"
  * The measure for being able to determine the closeness of two objects is our ability to compare and contrast them. Think comparator methods.
* "It is sometimes necessary perhaps even to invent a name, if there be none at hand, for that to which it may be properly applied: e.g. if a rudder be attributed to a ship, it is not properly so attributed, for a rudder is not predicated of a ship so far as it is not reciprocate, inasmuch as a ship is not said to be the ship of a rudder."
  * Having qualities does not an object make. There are pieces which are always necessary to understanding an object, and pieces which certainly aren't. This definitely comes into dialogue with Locke's idea of Mixed Modes
* "In short, nothing predicated without any conjunction, is either true or false, and all the above-named are predicated without conjunction. Not but that a thing of this kind may appear, to happen in contraries, which are predicated conjunctively, for 'Socrates is well' is opposed to 'Socrates is sick,' yet neither in these is always necessary, that one should be true and the other false, for while Socrates lives, one will be true and the other false, but when he is not alive, both will be false."
  * The idea that an object does not always remain in one state. The must be designed to allow change.
* "Moreover, besides what we have mentioned, the better and more excellent appear to be prior by nature. The common people are accustomed to say, that those whom they chiefly honour and especially regard, are prior in their esteem; but this is nearly the most foreign of all the modes, wherefore such are (nearly) the modes of priority which have been enumerated."
  * On how to compare things. Greatness taking precedence to weakness is the foundation of working with any large data set.
* "Things are called simultaneous simply and most properly, whose generation occurs at the same time, for neither is prior or posterior; these, therefore, are said to be simultaneous as to time. But by nature those are simultaneous, which reciprocate according to the consequence of existence, although one, is by no means the cause of the existence of the other"
  * While we are allowed to have several instances of a similar type, they are not necessarily the same tangible object.
* "Of motion, there are six species, generation, corruption, increase, dimution, alternation, and change of place."
  * Operations we can perform on objects in a data set
