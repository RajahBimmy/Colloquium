# Weaving the Web (1999)

## Tim Berners-Lee

### Relevance

Weaving the Web is one of the most central pieces to this colloquium. It illustrates the true potential of how far collaborative software development can take us. In designing the web, Berners-Lee set out with two goals: to offer users a way to collaborate with each other on any of their own projects, and to use this collaboration to further the advancement of modern human technology. Berners-Lee's mantra is similar to Stallman's, but we see how it really works in the grand scheme of things. His life's mission has been to unite society through technology, and I find myself agreeing with him on all counts.

### Context

Tim Berners-Lee worked at CERN through the 80s and 90s, where he dealt primarily with Hypertext. At the dawn of the 90s, it was his idea to pull together Hypertext with the existing framework of the Internet to form the World Wide Web. He founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) under the standard of royalty-free technology, to allow users full ease of access and experience.

### Quotes

* "It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system."
  * On how to go about presenting his vision and executing it.
* "It had to be completely de-centralized; no need to ask for access from anyone else, and no centrally linked database."
  * On the philosophy of keeping the internet open to all, and not reliant on some company's servers or forced experiences.
* "It was worth it to sacrifice advanced features for greater user accessibility"
  * On switching from Objective-C to C as his primary programming language, and stressing the idea that great software happens when many great people are involved.
* "You can't convince people to invest something unless they see it in action."
  * On the necessity to build a working prototype of the Web to encourage others to help him.
* "They introduced an unprecedented marketing policy: Download it for free... make an additional pro version"
  * On how to monetize open software.
* "We realized it was smarter to offer a platform others could build upon, rather than limiting our scope to our own software."
  * On the web's priority of valuing itself as a platform more than a proprietary piece of software.
* "The beauty of the web is that it is a web, not a hierarchy."
  * On leaving the web open and moderator-less.
* "Free speech in Hypertext is the right to link, which is the right to communicate via the web."

* "Grassroots projects are a challenge, but always so much fun. We're always building tools for one another."
  * On the communities which have grown out of collaboration via the web.
