## Ibn Khaldun

### Relevance

Khaldun's formula for a strong society has flairs which both incite and derail thoughts for community. He supports Locke's ideas of empiricism, while backing Hobbes' need for a sovereign and playing into Plato's level of difference between object and instance. If we follow his model, we see that groups form around a common goal, than progressively lose power as one sovereign emerges. Such can be true as projects grow closer to completion.

### Context

While we don't talk about him much, Ibn Khaldun was totally doing what everyone else was doing way before it was cool. Just like Torvalds swept in and stole Stallman's thunder, Hobbes stole Khaldun's (albeit three hundred years later). Khaldun touches on almost everyone in some way or another, laying out how humans come to thought, what they do with those thoughts, and how the societies they build can expand and prosper. He's really the little-known grandfather of historiography.

### Quotes

* "This is because leadership exists only through superiority, and superiority only through group feeling, as we have mentioned before. Leadership over people, therefore, must, of necessity, derive from a group feeling that is superior to each individual group feeling. Each individual group feeling that becomes aware of the superiority of the group feeling of the leader is ready to obey and follow (that leader)."
  * Rather than humans being naturally at war or naturally trying to construct, we are born to be subservient. Kind of a weird thought which I'll disagree with, but fits into his Hobbes-ian view of the world.
* "The goal to which group feeling leads is royal authority. This is because, as we have mentioned before, group feeling gives protection and makes possible mutual defense, the pressing of claims,99 and every other kind of social activ­ity. We have also mentioned before, that according to their nature, human beings need someone to act as a restraining influence and mediator in every social organization, in order to keep the members from (fighting) with each other."
  * Khaldun's calling for a sovereign long before Hobbes does in __Leviathan__. We need to stick together to survive, but moderation is necessary.
* "When a dynasty is, firmly established, it can dispense with group feeling. The reason for this is that people find it difficult to submit to large dynastic (power) at the beginning, unless they are forced into submission by strong superiority. (The new government) is something strange. People are not familiar with, or used to, its rule. But once leadership is firmly vested in the members of the family qualified to exercise royal au­thority in the dynasty, and once (royal authority) has been passed on by inheritance over many generations and through successive dynasties, the beginnings are forgotten, and the members of that family are clearly marked as leaders. It has become a firmly established article of faith that one must be subservient and submissive to them"
  * This is the difference between an early project and a "finished" one. There comes a point where user assistance is no longer necessary, as much as it is a potential new idea. Software will begin to function like a well-oiled machine, at which point hackers move onto the next project.
* "A dynasty rarely establishes itself firmly in lands with many different tribes and groups. The reason for this is the differences in opinions and desires. Behind each opinion and desire, there is a group feeling defending it. At any time, therefore, there is much opposition to a dynasty and rebellion against it, even if the dynasty possesses group feeling, because each group feeling under the control of the ruling dynasty thinks that it has in itself (enough) strength and power."
  * Open Source is not worried about this problem, remember "With enough eyes, all bugs are shallow" -Linus' law. -__The Cathedral and the Bazaar__
* "Among the things that corrupt sedentary culture, there is the disposition toward pleasures and indulgence in them, because of the great luxury (that prevails). It leads to diversification of the desires of the belly for pleasurable food and drink. This is followed by diversification of the pleasures of sex through various ways of sexual intercourse, such as adultery and homosexuality."
  * I think the goal of collaboration is to make life easier for everyone, so I disagree with Khaldun's statement that sedentary culture leads to corruption. In fact, I think we'll never hit a truly sedentary culture, as there's always a way to make life better in some way or another.
* "A habit is a firmly rooted quality acquired by doing a certain action and repeating it time after time, until the form of (that action) is firmly fixed."
  * This builds off the __How to Design Programs__ structure of starting with small data, then continually expanding the size and necessary methods until you get to your solution.
* "Crafts can improve and increase only when many people demand them. The reason for this is that man cannot afford to give away his labor for nothing, because it is his (source of) profit and livelihood"
  * "Free as in Free Speech, not Free as in Free Beer." __Free Software, Free Society__ dispels this notion that we're simply working for the greater good. Of course we're self-interested, it's a way to make a living because people want what's in demand! That being said, collaboration aims to make this process as optimal as possible.
* "For instance, if a man thinks of bringing into existence a roof to shelter him, he will progress in his mind (from the roof) to the wall supporting the roof, and then to the foundation upon which the wall stands. Here, his thinking will end, and he will then start to work on the foundation, then (go on to) the wall, and then (to) the roof, with which his action will end. This is what is meant by the saying: "The beginning of action is the end of thinking, and the beginning of thinking is the end of action.""
  * This is so genius, and how we come to separate the class from the instance. Huge in understanding OOP and important in differentiating between the tangible and the form for Plato in __The Republic__.
* "Man is essentially ignorant, and becomes learned through acquiring (knowledge). We have already explained at the beginning of these sections that man belongs to the genus of animals and that God distinguished him from them by the ability to think, which He gave man and through which man is able to arrange his actions in an orderly manner. This is the discerning intellect."
  * Empiricism! This is what Locke was arguing in __An Essay on Human Understanding__. We begin life a blank slate, and become wise through experience.
* "Royal authority is something natural to human beings, because of its social implications, as we have stated. In view of his natural disposition and his power of logical reasoning, man is more inclined toward good qualities than toward bad qualities, because the evil in him is the result of the animal powers in him, and in as much as he is a human being, he is more inclined toward goodness and good qualities."
  * We naturally strive towards adhering to the sovereign, who is potentially corruptable, but generally we believe in striving towards the greater good so we don't need to worry too often.
