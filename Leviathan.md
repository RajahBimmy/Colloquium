# Leviathan (1651)

## Thomas Hobbes

### Relevance

While a little bleak, Hobbes has a get-it-done personality. If you want a society to avoid chaos and act in the best interest of people, you have to make compromises and hand over the wheel to administrators. This is true in both open and closed source communities. Regardless of whether you're working with a manager at a company or an author of source code, Brooks, McConnell, and Raymond all maintain that you must sacrifice some level of authority to contribute to the greater good of the project.

### Context

Writing in the 1600s, Hobbes' big goal was to understand why humans think the way they do, and why the form governments in ways which help and harm them so. His prevailing idea in Leviathan is that government must be representative of the people, but that one absolute sovereign is the best way to handle this. In Book I, he examines man's state in the natural world, while in Book II he explores statecraft and the role of the sovereign.

### Quotes

* "This is the Generation of that great LEVIATHAN, or rather (to speake more reverently) of that Mortall God, to which wee owe under the Immortall God, our peace and defence. For by this Authoritie, given him by every particular man in the Common-Wealth, he hath the use of so much Power and Strength conferred on him, that by terror thereof, he is inabled to forme the wills of them all, to Peace at home, and mutuall ayd against their enemies abroad."
  * We enter into contracts to avoid a state of war with those enemies who wish to harm us, not out of the idea of what we can achieve. I agree that while our motives may be selfish, whose to say they have to spring from that violent of conjecture
* "So it appeareth plainly, to my understanding, both from Reason, and Scripture, that the Soveraign Power, whether placed in One Man, as in Monarchy, or in one Assembly of men, as in Popular, and Aristocraticall Common-wealths, is as great, as possibly men can be imagined to make it. And though of so unlimited a Power, men may fancy many evill consequences, yet the consequences of the want of it, which is perpetuall warre of every man against his neighbour, are much worse."
  * It's better to have one organization which may go corrupt than no organization. This is the whole reason Free Software fell apart. They aimed to high with their research, and didn't produce enough. It's better to cave in and rely on proprietary software than sit back and let the world go by because you couldn't find the source code to everything.
* "And according to this proper, and generally received meaning of the word, A FREE-MAN, is "he, that in those things, which by his strength and wit he is able to do, is not hindred to doe what he has a will to." But when the words Free, and Liberty, are applyed to any thing but Bodies, they are abused"
  * Stallman and Berners-Lee both challenge this idea, believing that freedom has outgrown human bodies, and developed into the field of human creation as well.
* "But as men, for the atteyning of peace, and conservation of themselves thereby, have made an Artificiall Man, which we call a Common-wealth; so also have they made Artificiall Chains, called Civill Lawes, which they themselves, by mutuall covenants, have fastned at one end, to the lips of that Man, or Assembly, to whom they have given the Soveraigne Power; and at the other end to their own Ears. These Bonds in their own nature but weak, may neverthelesse be made to hold, by the danger, though not by the difficulty of breaking them."
  * These chains can make us dependent on a larger system, yes. But that doesn't mean we'd be better off free. If we're approaching this from a development standpoint, by not allowing more eyes to see our code, we naively assume we know best, and aren't open to ideas for greater innvoation.
* "A PUBLIQUE MINISTER, is he, that by the Soveraign, (whether a Monarch, or an Assembly,) is employed in any affaires, with Authority to represent in that employment, the Person of the Common-wealth."
  * This section relates directly to authorship in __Pro Git__. If the maintainers of the source code act as public ministers (or maybe even a member of their team does), we assure that there are actors who will maintain the balance between developer and community.
* "Subjects Are To Be Taught, Not To Affect Change Of Government ... For the prosperity of a People ruled by an Aristocraticall, or Democraticall assembly, commeth not from Aristocracy, nor from Democracy, but from the Obedience, and Concord of the Subjects; nor do the people flourish in a Monarchy, because one man has the right to rule them, but because they obey him."
  * This is blatantly false when working with software design. To limit yourself and not be willing to expand or change your systems when some new challenge or idea presents itself is painting yourself into a corner. If we are to accept McConnell's idea that software development is like a bridge, then maybe this idea is passible. But in the modern software development world, patches make the product.
* "I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner."
  * Just as you must compromise rights to join a society, you must compromise autonomy when contributing to projects. Remember mosaic's relationship with the world wide web.
* "Also "If a man be trusted to judge between man and man," it is a precept of the Law of Nature, "that he deale Equally between them." For without that, the Controversies of men cannot be determined but by Warre."
  * A major flaw in contribution is the potential for human error and rejection, but that's also where the magic lies. If something isn't working the way you want it to, you can always go out and build it yourself. Your version might wind up better!
* "So that in the nature of man, we find three principal causes of quarrel: First, Competition; Secondly, Dissidence; Thirdly, Glory. The first, maketh men invade for Gain; the second, for Safety; and the third, for Reputation."
  * This is true to software development as well. The gains are to develop things which we will find use for, the safety is making a living and being able to maintain or enhance your present digital lifestyle, and the reputation is that exciting checkbox you get when you contribute to a project on GitHub. Remember Seinfeld's quote about staying at it every single day.
* PARAPHRASE: The Sovereign has the right to change the form of government, act for the people, put to death his subjects, act as judge, choose ministers and officers, reward and punish, and setup guidelines.
  * This is honestly just good management skills (aside from the put to death part)
