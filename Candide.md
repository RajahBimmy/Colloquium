# Candide (1759)

## Voltaire

### Relevance

Candide's unapologetic attack on ignorance gained through total acceptance of one ideology is what makes it reusable with almost any work. While we don't know Voltaire's specific stance on religion as a whole, we know he has no patience for this "all for the best" mentality. Sure, there are good things, but part of the human experience is the bad. Raymond borrows this mentality when departs from Stallman and the Free Software movement to pursue open source. While Free Software is a wonderful idea in theory, it doesn't have the same level of civil rights as say, free speech, and so doing little to no work while defending your philosophy will leave you with nothing to show at the end of the day. Candide's garden is the same as Raymond calling out the FSF for never outputting usable material.

### Context

Candide was Voltaire's response to everything wrong in the fanatic religious society he lived in. He was tired of people talking about "the best of all possible worlds" and posited a ridiculous story to poke holes in the foundation of this philosophy.

### Quotes

* "Pangloss gave instruction in metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology. He proved admirably that there cannot possibly be an effect without a cause and that in this best of all possible worlds the baron’s castle was the most beautiful of all castles and his wife the best of all possible baronesses. —It is clear, said he, that things cannot be otherwise than they are, for since everything is made to serve an end, everything necessarily serves the best end. Observe: noses were made to support spectacles, hence we have spectacles. Legs, as anyone can plainly see, were made to be breeched, and so we have breeches. . . . Consequently, those who say everything is well are uttering mere stupidities; they should say everything is for the best."
  * Voltaire is toying with us through Pangloss, drawing our attention to obsession over cause and effect.
* "Yes, said Martin; but did the passengers aboard his ship have to perish too? God punished the scoundrel, the devil drowned the others."
  * This is what happens when we cherry-pick our beliefs instead of following them through the way they were meant to be interpreted.
* "I should like to know which is worse, being raped a hundred times by negro pirates, having a buttock cut off, running the gauntlet in the Bulgar army, being flogged and hanged in an auto-da-fé, being dissected and rowing in the galleys—experiencing, in a word, all the miseries through which we have passed—or else just sitting here and doing nothing? —It’s a hard question, said Candide."
  * This feels very reminiscent of Williams' interpretation of Raymond's attack on Free Software. If they spend so much time worrying about the philosophy and no time developing a functioning product, wouldn't it be better for them to just do nothing? Political agenda is wonderful, but it needs action in order to function.
