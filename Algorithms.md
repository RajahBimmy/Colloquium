# Introduction to Algorithms (1990)

## Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein

### Relevance

Introduction to Algorithms is great when taken side by side with How to Design Programs. Algorithms introduces a mathematical approach to the study of algorithms, while HTDP focuses more on step by step psuedocode, and presenting real life cases which can be used to better understand these algorithms. The basis for all sorting algorithms is our ability to compare things against one another to determine some level of hierarchy, an idea presented extensively in Aristotle's Categories.

### Context

Introduction to Algorithms is the staple of algorithms taught in a university environment. Author Ron Rivest is an outspoken Software activist, and focuses extensively on using cryptography to aid strong democracies.
