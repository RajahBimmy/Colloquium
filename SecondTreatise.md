# The Second Treatise of Government (1689)

## John Locke

### Relevance

John Locke's idea of the social contract feels very reminiscent of Eric Raymond's Bazaar. It presents the idea that we are not inherently in a state of war with each other, and that in fact we build societies out of a goal to survive as one, which then turns into striving towards a greater society (what Ibn Khaldun would describe as the sedentary state). In software development, I believe the right to revolt is the right to drop dependencies on other pieces of software which impose new constraints which were not a part of the original contract, and move onto a new community or piece of software which better supports your system.

### Context

Locke put together the two treatises in response to Filmer's Patriarcha and William III's overthrow of the English monarchy. While the first treatise serves as more of an attack on Patriarcha, the second serves as Locke's blueprint for how human society leaves the state of nature and begins developing.

### Quotes

* "And hence it is, that he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power, does thereby put himself into a state of war with him; it being to be understood as a declaration of a design upon his life"
  * On what it takes to get man to enter into a state of war.
* "And here we have the plain difference between the state of nature and the state of war, which however some men have confounded, are as far distant, as a state of peace, good will, mutual assistance and preservation, and a state of enmity, malice, violence and mutual destruction, are one from another. Men living together according to reason, without a common superior on earth, with authority to judge between them, is properly the state of nature. But force, or a declared design of force, upon the person of another, where there is no common superior on earth to appeal to for relief, is the state of war"
  * On contrasting how naturally we are selfish, but this does not make us innately violent, just focused on mutually assured survival instead of avoid destruction
* "No body can give more power than he has himself; and he that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it. "
  * We cannot offer up to a government that which we do not have.
* "Man being born, as has been proved, with a title to perfect freedom, and an uncontrouled enjoyment of all the rights and privileges of the law of nature, equally with any other man, or number of men in the world, hath by nature a power, not only to preserve his property, that is, his life, liberty and estate, against the injuries and attempts of other men; but to judge of, and punish the breaches of that law in others, as he is persuaded the offence deserves, even with death itself, in crimes where the heinousness of the fact, in his opinion, requires it."
  * We are all created entirely as equals. We might have specials skills, but as human beings no one is inherently greater than another.
* "But because no political society can be, nor subsist, without having in itself the power to preserve the property, and in order thereunto, punish the offences of all those of that society; there, and there only is political society, where every one of the members hath quitted this natural power, resigned it up into the hands of the community in all cases that exclude him not from appealing for protection to the law established by it."
  * Communities have a right to defend themselves, which plays into McConnell's idea of defensive programming.
* "For when any number of men have, by the consent of every individual, made a community, they have thereby made that community one body, with a power to act as one body"
  * Men make one body in the same way that Berners-Lee's web forms one large neural network which enhances society's capabilities.
* "But submitting to the laws of any country, living quietly, and enjoying privileges and protection under them, makes not a man a member of that society"
  * Just because we use a program's resources, does not make us bound to them. This is the idea of the bazaar model. We can pick and choose. There is no need to base an entire software system on platforms which follow your design paradigm, pick the best available.
* "The great and chief end, therefore, of men's uniting into commonwealths, and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property."
  * We form communities to build things which make our lives easier, and may in fact help others in the process.
* "In these and the like cases, when the government is dissolved, the people are at liberty to provide for themselves, by erecting a new legislative, differing from the other, by the change of persons, or form, or both, as they shall find it most for their safety and good: for the society can never, by the fault of another, lose the native and original right it has to preserve itself, which can only be done by a settled legislative, and a fair and impartial execution of the laws made by it."
  * On when the government collapses or becomes corrupt.
* "The end of government is the good of mankind; and which is best for mankind, that the people should be always exposed to the boundless will of tyranny, or that the rulers should be sometimes liable to be opposed, when they grow exorbitant in the use of their power, and employ it for the destruction, and not the preservation of the properties of their people?"
  * People should have the right to choose to rebel, or not use the software which they have already established as a dependency.
