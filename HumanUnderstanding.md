# An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689)

## John Locke

### Relevance

In Book II, Locke comments on the nature of the nature of objects coming from the same type. He maintains that all objects are capable of relations and comparisons, an idea which serves as the basic foundation for all sorting algorithms, in addition to the idea that these relations can help us to better understand items more than their standard descriptors. He also provides his definition for abstraction, which he believes is fundamental to understanding his metaphors, just as a programmer knows abstraction is fundamental to good software design.

In Book III, Locke introduces the idea of Modes and Mixed Modes. A Mode is a simple idea or descriptor (i.e. red, small, loud, etc.); whereas a Mixed Mode is are combinations of several Modes to make up one larger concept (think of Inheritance in Object-Oriented programming, or database relations [is a],[has many],etc.).

### Context

Locke went into writing this book as a response to the theories which existed at the time about innate ideas. He took issue with the fact that contemporaries like Leibniz argued against the idea that the human mind is a blank slate. Locke's ideas on classification were hotly debated after the release of this work, but provided a level of backbone to infuse math with dialogue.

### Quotes

* "I think it will be needless to enumerate all the particular simple ideas belonging to each sense. Nor indeed is it possible if we would; there being a great many more of them belonging to most of the senses than we have names for."
  * Explaining how few ideas have simple names.
* "The qualities, then, that are in bodies, rightly considered are of three sorts: FIRST, The bulk, figure, number, situation, and motion or rest of their solid parts. Those are in them, whether we perceive them or not; and when they are of that size that we can discover them, we have by these an idea of the thing as it is in itself; as is plain in artificial things. These I call PRIMARY QUALITIES. SECONDLY, The power that is in any body, by reason of its insensible primary qualities, to operate after a peculiar manner on any of our senses, and thereby produce in US the different ideas of several colours, sounds, smells, tastes, &c. These are usually called SENSIBLE QUALITIES. THIRDLY, The power that is in any body, by reason of the particular constitution of its primary qualities, to make such a change in the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of ANOTHER BODY, as to make it operate on our senses differently from what it did before. Thus the sun has a power to make wax white, and fire to make lead fluid."
  * On the qualities all objects have. Descriptors, actions, and relationships. This is the equivalent of data which composes an object, methods which it can call, and comparators which can effect the objects state of being in a larger program. Contradictions come because Locke maintains that the relationships can change the object into another one, while we know in programming this is untrue.
* "The use of words then being to stand as outward mark of our internal ideas, and those ideas being taken from particular things, if every particular idea that we take up should have a distinct name, names must be endless. To prevent this, the mind makes the particular ideas received from particular objects to become general; which is done by considering them as they are in the mind such appearances,—separate from all other existences, and the circumstances of real existence, as time, place, or any other concomitant ideas."
  * On the need for abstraction in order to understand the world.
* "Secondly, there are others compounded of simple ideas of several kinds, put together to make one complex one;—v.g. beauty, consisting of a certain composition of colour and figure, causing delight to the beholder; theft, which being the concealed change of the possession of anything, without the consent of the proprietor, contains, as is visible, a combination of several ideas of several kinds: and these I call MIXED MODES."
  * Defining mixed modes as types which are composed of various pieces of other data. Think of them as simple structs.
* "Thirdly, the last sort of complex ideas is that we call RELATION, which consists in the consideration and comparing one idea with another."
  * On the importance of ideas being relatable. Since they are all of a same larger abstract type, we need ways to compare one to another, much like we need comparators in programming to understand which objects are more valuable.
* "I confess power includes in it some kind of RELATION (a relation to action or change,) as indeed which of our ideas of what kind soever, when attentively considered, does not."
  * Power needs relation. The greater an object is, the more we need to know how to compare and quantify it when held against other objects.
* "Time in general is to duration as place to expansion. They are so much of those boundless oceans of eternity and immensity as is set out and distinguished from the rest, as it were by landmarks; and so are made use of to denote the position of FINITE real beings, in respect one to another, in those uniform infinite oceans of duration and space."
  * Bit of a stretch, but Locke is introducing the two most important trade-off qualities we worry about in memory management. The Time vs. Space debate. If Locke were to include cost as well, he'd have been a great programmer.
* "I say, our SPECIFIC ideas of substances are nothing else but A COLLECTION OF CERTAIN NUMBER OF SIMPLE IDEAS, CONSIDERED AS UNITED IN ONE THING. These ideas of substances, though they are commonly simple apprehensions, and the names of them simple terms, yet in effect are complex and compounded."
  * On how individual ideas can be combined into one greater one. Like OOP!
* "To conclude this consideration of the imperfection and abuse of language. The ends of language in our discourse with others being chiefly these three: First, to make known one man's thoughts or ideas to another; Secondly, to do so with as much ease and quickness as possible; and, Thirdly, thereby to convey the knowledge of things: language is either abused or deficient, when it fails of any of these three."
  * Keep it simple stupid. Ideas should be clear and succinct. Locke believes names should reflect this, McConnell believes that naming of variables should reflect this.
* "First Remedy: To use no Word without an Idea annexed to it. Second Remedy: To have distinct, determinate Ideas annexed to Words, especially in mixed Modes. Third Remedy: To apply Words to such ideas as common use has annexed them to. Fourth Remedy: To declare the meaning in which we use them."
  * On how to fix the issue of complex entities. Don't waste time, space or lines of code.
